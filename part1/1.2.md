# 1.2: course information step2

## Task

- Refactor the Content component so that it does not render any names of parts or their number of exercises by itself. Instead it only renders three Part components of which each renders the name and number of exercises of one part.

## Solution

App.js:

```javascript
const Header = ({ course }) => {
  return (
    <h1>{course}</h1>
  )
}

const Part = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{props.part} {props.exercise}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

const Content = (props) => {

  const part1 = props.part1
  const part2 = props.part2
  const part3 = props.part3

  const exercises1 = props.exercises1
  const exercises2 = props.exercises2
  const exercises3 = props.exercises3

  return (
    <div>
      <Part part={part1} exercise={exercises1}/>
      <Part part={part2} exercise={exercises2}/>
      <Part part={part3} exercise={exercises3}/>
    </div>
  )
}

const Total = (props) => {

  const exercises = props.exercises1 + props.exercises2 + props.exercises3  

  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        Number of exercises {exercises}
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}

const App = () => {
  const course = 'Half Stack application development'
  const part1 = 'Fundamentals of React'
  const exercises1 = 10
  const part2 = 'Using props to pass data'
  const exercises2 = 7
  const part3 = 'State of a component'
  const exercises3 = 14

  return (
    <div>
      <Header course={course} />
      <Content part1={part1}  part2={part2} part3={part3} exercises1={exercises1} exercises2={exercises2} exercises3={exercises3} />
      <Total exercises1={exercises1} exercises2={exercises2} exercises3={exercises3} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```
