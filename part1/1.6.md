# 1.6: unicafe step1

## Task

Like most companies, Unicafe collects feedback from its customers. Your task is to implement a web application for collecting customer feedback. There are only three options for feedback: good, neutral, and bad.

The application must display the total number of collected feedback for each category. Your final application could look like this:

![final version of the application](./images/image1.png)

Note that your application needs to work only during a single browser session. Once you refresh the page, the collected feedback is allowed to disappear.

It is advisable to use the same structure that is used in material and previous exercise. File index.js is as follows:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'

import App from './App'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />)
```

You can use the code below as a starting point for the App.js file:

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react'

const App = () => {
  // save clicks of each button to its own state
  const [good, setGood] = useState(0)
  const [neutral, setNeutral] = useState(0)
  const [bad, setBad] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      code here
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

## Solution

App.js:

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react'

const App = () => {
  // save clicks of each button to its own state
  const [good, setGood] = useState(0)
  const [neutral, setNeutral] = useState(0)
  const [bad, setBad] = useState(0)

  const goodClick = () => {
    setGood(good + 1)
  }

  const neutralClick = () => {
    setNeutral(neutral + 1)
  }

  const badClick = () => {
    setBad(bad + 1)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>give feedback</h1>
      <button onClick={goodClick}>good</button>
      <button onClick={neutralClick}>neutral</button>
      <button onClick={badClick}>bad</button>
      <h1>statistics</h1>
      <p>good {good}</p>
      <p>neutral {neutral}</p>
      <p>bad {bad}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```
