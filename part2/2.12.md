# 2.12 data for countries step1

## Task

The API [https://restcountries.com](https://restcountries.com) provides data for different countries in a machine-readable format, a so-called REST API.

Create an application, in which one can look at data of various countries. The application should probably get the data from the endpoint [all](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all).

The user interface is very simple. The country to be shown is found by typing a search query into the search field.

If there are too many (over 10) countries that match the query, then the user is prompted to make their query more specific:

If there are ten or fewer countries, but more than one, then all countries matching the query are shown:

When there is only one country matching the query, then the basic data of the country (eg. capital and area), its flag and the languages spoken there, are shown:
